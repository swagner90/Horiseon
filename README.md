# 
## B.) Changes Made to Web Application
*Note: Comments for all changes can be found inside both index.html and style.css files.

**For "index.html":**

    1.) The <div> tags were removed and replaced with semantic tags when appropriate. (e.g. <header>, <article>, <footer>, etc.)

    2.) Fixed a broken link by adding id attribute. (Search Engine Optimization was missing an id, causing href link in Navigation Bar to fail.)

    3.) Added an additional class for each <article> in order to clean up CSS code redundancy.

**For "style.css":**

    1.) The <div> tags were replaced with corresponding semantic tags.

    2.) Some elements were merged into one selector in order to reduce redundant code. 

    3.) The classes "content-block", "content-picture", "benefit-block", and "benefit-image" were created in the index.html file in order to condense CSS code.
